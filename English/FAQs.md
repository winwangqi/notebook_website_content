## [Why do they say “may not” for things which people shouldn't do?](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/189974/why-do-they-say-may-not-for-things-which-people-shouldnt-do)

**I have seen in so many place where they would have mentioned "You may not.." etc for the things people shouldn't do. For eg: in companies where USB is not allowed, they will mention like this "You may not use USB/CD etc", similarly "You may not download free softwares", "You may not tailgate the doors" etc.**

**These all things should be like this right "You should not use USB/CD etc", "You should not download free softwares" etc, this "May not" seems like saying "optional" it may indicate like "people may follow" etc**

**Can anyone guide me in this? I always get confuse in this.**

In this context, may means that you have permission to do something, so may not means you are not permitted to do something.

should is generally interpreted less strictly, as describing a desire or strong suggestion, rather than a requirement. So should not means that they would prefer or recommend you not do something, not that it's prohibited. For example, You should not go swimming during a thunderstorm.

Sometimes these can be conflated, though. You should not drive above the speed limit, because it's against the law and you might get a ticket.
