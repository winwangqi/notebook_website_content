在会议中讨论提案

<Video src="./ef-meeting-vocabulary-proposals.mp4" poster="./GE_10.1.1.2.1.jpg" />

> [JOAN] All right, so communication has really been the big issue with Sunset.
> [JOAN] What can we do about it? I mean, when I’m there on Monday, in a meeting with them, what solution can I propose?
> [SALLY] Well, a new CEO and CFO is a good start, but is it enough? One way to solve the problem might be to replace even more managers.
> [SIMON] I'm not sure I agree with that.
> [TODD] And I really disagree. We have to be careful about their morale. They're losing their two biggest executives. That's a huge change already.
> [HARRY] Well, at least let's send them to some communication training. They're awful!
> [JOAN] That's a possibility.
> [TODD] I'd like to propose some formal team-building.
> [JOAN] Okay. What do you have in mind?
> [TODD] How difficult would it be to bring some of the Sunset managers here for, say, a week?
> [JOAN] Well, it's not in the budget, but...
> [SALLY] I really like that idea. We need to meet these people.
> [HARRY] I think so, too. If they come here and see how we do things...
> [SIMON] Let's take that one step further and send people over there, too. We need to start building personal relationships with them.
> [JOAN] Well, I think those are all excellent ideas. I can't make any promises, but I'll try to find some money for them.
> [TODD] And, of course, if you do go there, you're going to be evaluating their managers.
> [JOAN] Of course.
