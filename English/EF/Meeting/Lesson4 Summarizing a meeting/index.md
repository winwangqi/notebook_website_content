> [JOAN] Okay, so David met with the board of directors this morning. They've decided to move quickly to integrate the two companies.
> [TODD] Smart move. Finally.
> [JOAN] Yes. Simon made me aware of major problems there three months ago. I did tell David about it, but, CEOs sometimes just...
> [JOAN] Anyway, after listening to Sally and Harry today, I wish that I'd pushed David more. Now the board is not happy.
> [TODD] We all should've pushed David more.
> [JOAN] Yes, maybe we should have. But what’s done is done. Now, I need help with a decision. The board has decided not to replace the CEO of Sunset.
> [SIMON] I'm not surprised.
> [TODD] It's a reasonable move. If we're integrating the two companies, we don't need two CEOs.
> [JOAN] But we'll be hiring a chief operating officer for Sunset.
> [SIMON] A COO? That makes sense. Someone has to be in charge over there.
> [JOAN] And I was offered the job.
> [TODD] Should we congratulate you?
> [JOAN] No. I turned it down. I have a great team and family in this city. And Sunset is a mess.
> [SIMON] I'm glad that you're staying. And I think that I know why I'm in this meeting.
> [JOAN] Tell me about your friend, Ed Fife.
> [SIMON] Oh, he's wonderful. Excellent manager. His team loves him.
> [JOAN] Thanks. I'll talk to him when I'm at Sunset. Well, that's it for now. Thanks for everything, guys.
> [TODD] Any doubts or regrets about turning down the job?
> [JOAN] None.

It was a very interesting meeting. There were a lot of different opinions. The COO suggested that the board move quickly to accept the government's offer. The CFO disagreed .

The CEO agreed that they shouldn't move too quickly, but she also decided they should schedule another meeting with the government for next week.
