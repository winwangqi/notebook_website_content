> [HARRY] Congratulations!
> [JOAN] Thank you, Harry. Now, as I was saying, it’ll be my job to get the two companies working together smoothly.
> [JOAN] I'll probably be flying back and forth for the next few weeks. Todd will be in charge here whenever I'm at Sunset.
> [JOAN] That’s going to involve a lot of planning, and I don't have much time, so, uh, let’s conclude this meeting quickly.
> [JOAN] Now, where was I? Oh, yes. As a next step, in the next week or so, please keep me informed about any problems that you're having with Sunset.
> [JOAN] Give me details. I’d really appreciate your input on this.
> [JOAN] Let me see. I’ll, uh, follow up on the idea of team building, and I’ll also send an email summarizing this meeting.
> [JOAN] Oh, and, uh, one more thing: This discussion is confidential. Nothing leaves this room.
> [TODD] Yes, please. No talking about firing people at Sunset or flying them here. Those poor people have enough rumors to worry about already.
